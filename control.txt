Start Date: 2021-12-31                # Start date of data request.

# Since HRRR GRIB files cover the contiguous U.S., lat. and long. values
# should represent those areas. However, GRIB longitude values are
# in "degrees east of the Prime Meridian". This is corrected in the code.
# So in this file, the latitude and longitude of Cleveland, Ohio for example,
# should be entered as follows:
# Example latitude: 41.4993
# Example longitude: -81.6944

# If you request u and v wind components, you must also request one or more
# wind levels. If you request temperature, you must also request one or more
# temperature levels.
# If you request turbulent kinetic energy, you must also request one or more
# turbulent kinetic energy levels.
# If you request pressure, you must also request one or more pressure levels.
# If you request specific humidity, you must also request one or more
# specific humidity levels.

# The height of each level varies based on location and weather.
# The approximate heights above ground level are as follows:
# Level 1:  10.8 meters
# Level 2:    40 meters
# Level 3:    91 meters
# Level 4:   176 meters
# Level 5:   299 meters
# Level 6:   460 meters
# Level 7:   654 meters
# Level 8:   875 meters
# Level 9:  1110 meters
# Level 10: 1390 meters
# Level 11: 1710 meters
# Level 12: 2080 meters

# More levels requested = longer download time.

# Date format examples for start or end date:
# 2022-01-01, 2022-07-27, 2019-11-15

# With typical internet speed and let's say you download 1 variable at
# 2 different heights, it should take about 1 minute to download
# 1 day of data. The size of that daily folder would be about 50 MB.

# If you run herbie to extract different/more variables than the
# previous run, new files will be created. The old files are not deleted,
# so the GRIB output will not make sense unless the old files are moved
# or deleted before you start herbie.

# If you already have all the GRIB data you need and the files have the
# correct Herbie directory structure, "Herbie Already Done?" should be "yes".
